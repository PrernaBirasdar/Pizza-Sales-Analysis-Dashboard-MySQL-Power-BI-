# KPI Requirements : 
# 1. Total Revenue : the sume of all total price 
select sum(total_price) As Total_Revenue from pizza_sales ; 

# 2. Average Order value : Dividing the total revenue by the total numbers of orders 
# We need to count total number of distinct orders 
select count(order_id) from pizza_sales ; 
select count(distinct order_id ) from pizza_sales ; 
# Average order value

select sum(quantity) As Total_Pizza_Sold from pizza_sales ;

# 4. Total Orders : The total number of order placed. 
select count(distinct order_id) As Total_orders from pizza_sales ;

# to check if the total_price column calculate correctly

# Chart Requirements : -  
# 1. Daily trend for total orders : -  
# STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%d-%m-%Y') converts your string date to proper DATE type.
# Now DAYNAME() can work correctly.
# This is DD-MM-YYYY format, but MySQL expects YYYY-MM-DD for date functions like DAYNAME().
# Data type issue:
# order_date is probably stored as VARCHAR (text), not DATE.
# MySQL cannot extract day names from a string directly.
